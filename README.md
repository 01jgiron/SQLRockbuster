# SQLRockbuster
SQL code for data analyzation of a fictional movie rental company 

**Introduction**
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the
world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime,
the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to
launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.
You’ve been hired as a data analyst by Rockbuster Stealth’s business intelligence (BI)
department to help with the launch strategy for the new online video service. The BI
department helps other departments, from inventory to customer insights, with data-related
queries. Your first task is to load all of Rockbuster’s data into a relational database
management system (RDBMS). Then, you’ll use SQL to analyze the data and answer any
ad-hoc business questions that other departments may have.
Before you can begin your analysis and answer more complex business questions, you’ll
need to acquire a good understanding of the various data points. You’ll eventually compile
the results of your analysis into an easily digestible format, which will be presented to the
Rockbuster Stealth Management Board.

**Key Questions and Objectives**
The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and
they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy. Here are
the main questions they’d like to answer:

● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?

● What was the average rental duration for all videos?

● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?

● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?

● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

**Data Set**
In this Achievement, you’ll be using a data set that contains information about Rockbuster’s
film inventory, customers, and payments, among other things. The first thing you’ll need to
do is load the data set into the PostgreSQL database. Keep in mind the following points
regarding the data set:

● It’s around 3MB and contains several files. This can be found linked in the project brief. 

● A relationship exists between two tables if a column name is present in both tables.
